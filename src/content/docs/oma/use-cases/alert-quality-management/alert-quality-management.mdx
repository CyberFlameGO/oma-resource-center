Alert Quality Management (AQM) is focused on reducing the volume of nuisance alerts, so that only alerts with business impact are asserted.  This will reduce a customer’s alert fatigue and ensure that attention is focused on the right places at the right times.  Improving alerting quality improves a customer’s capability to detect known business impacting issues faster.

AQM is part of the “Uptime, Performance, and Reliability”  workstream and intended to help the customer understand how effective their alerting strategy is by measuring the volume of incidents and user engagement of incident notifications (alerts). It is also intended to be used as a process to improve alerting quality by identifying noisiest conditions, determining their effectiveness, and tuning conditions to better identify business impacts.

The goal of AQM is to minimize and manage noisy policies while increasing user engagement with Incident Notifications. How this is accomplished is explained in this document.

## When to implement?

If the following concerns are relevant to your Observability program then you're a good candidates for AQM:
- “I have too many alerts.” 
- “My alerts aren’t relevant.”
- “My MTTx is too high.” (Note: Also consider the Service Level Management workflow.)
- “I can’t see the value of my observability tool.”

## Journey Map and Dependencies

AQM depends on the successful deployment of APM and Infrastructure instrumentation and the implementation of [alerting dashboards and webhooks](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence?toc=true).

## Business Objectives 

NOTE: AQM is intended to improve the value of existing alert configurations and detecting known or expected modes of failure, it does not encompass anomaly detection or AIOps, which are designed to detect unknown or unexpected modes of failure.  The two practices (AQM and ML/AI) work hand in hand, they are not mutually exclusive.

AQM’s business objective is to improve the quality of alerting for known issues, such as slow response times, increased errors, resource exhaustion, etc.  This is accomplished by implementing continuous improvement processes that identify and reduce nuisance alerts and increase user engagement in incident investigation.  Both of these metrics are measured in real time in the AQM dashboard.

## Business Outcome

Successful implementation of AQM should result in improved operational efficiency and increased service reliability.  Alert fatigue will be reduced as alerts become fewer and further between while having a more clear correlation with business impact.

At a more granular level, DevOps should see a reduction in alert volume, elimination of “always on” / long lived alerts, improved detection and response times, and an increased engagement with alerts.

Subsequently, this will give DevOps the time to engage in other best practices, such as the adoption of Service Level Objective oriented observability and reliability engineering.
